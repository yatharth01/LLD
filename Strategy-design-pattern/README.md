# Strategy Design Pattern Overview

## Introduction
The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, the code receives run-time instructions to select which in a family of algorithms to use. This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

## Problem It Solves
- **Algorithm Flexibility**: Allows for the selection of different algorithms based on the specific needs of the context without altering the code that uses them.
- **Code Duplication**: Reduces code duplication by allowing multiple algorithms to be applied interchangeably, eliminating the need for multiple conditional statements.
- **Tight Coupling**: Decouples the strategy (algorithm) from the context, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

## When to Use
- **Multiple Algorithms**: When a class needs to use several algorithms interchangeably.
- **Runtime Decision Making**: When the algorithm to be used isn't known until runtime, and you need a way to switch between algorithms dynamically.
- **Avoiding Conditionals**: When you find yourself using many conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `switch`) to choose different behaviors.

## Where Do We See Its Uses
- **Sorting Algorithms**: In Javaâ€™s `Collections.sort()`, where different sorting strategies can be applied.
- **Payment Processing**: In e-commerce systems, where different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.) are implemented as strategies.
- **Compression Algorithms**: Used in file compression utilities to switch between different compression strategies (e.g., ZIP, RAR).
- **Validation Frameworks**: Where different validation rules are applied depending on the context.

## Conclusion
The Strategy Design Pattern is an effective way to encapsulate algorithms or behaviors, making them easily interchangeable and promoting code reusability. It allows for clean separation of concerns, enabling algorithms to evolve independently of the clients that use them. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple algorithms might be applied in different situations, enhancing the flexibility and maintainability of the code.
